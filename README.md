# Lockdown-Cocktail-V2
## Code Institute Milestone Project 2: Interactive Frontend Development

Lockdown Cocktail is a project that came to be during the UK national lockdown of 
November 2020. During this time, cocktail bars were closed and consumers were unable 
to head out for cocktail drinks. The premise of the site is for consumers to create a cocktail
at home. Since cocktails are generally more complicated to make, I thought it would be fun 
to give people the receipe, and a visual image of their cocktail, once they 
have made it to compare.

### UX

#### Strategy
Lockdown Cocktail is a fun and informative website for cocktail drinkers who wish to
whip up a cocktail in the comfort of their own home. During Covid-19, local and national lockdowns 
have meant that cocktail bars have been closed to the public leaving cocktail drinkers at a loss
as to how to consume their beloved cocktails. The project is aimed at women between the ages of 18-40 
who would normally enjoy a social cocktail out at a cocktail bar with friends. These users will want clear 
information on how to whip up a cocktail but it is important that the site encapsulates the feminine fun 
of heading out for cocktails and interacting with a mixologist at the bar. This feel will be created by the 
projects choice of colour, copy, functionality and typography. These users will have a choice to search for 
their favourite cocktail receipe or generate a random cocktail to view at the click of a button. 

As a user I want to:

* be able to search for the name of my favourite cocktail by name or ingredient, view and then easily recreate it.
* be inspired by a random cocktail choice and view (a fun feature to recreate the feel of asking the mixologist to choose a drink for you and make it).
* be easily directed to any social media channels that can add additional viewing material to entice a user to connect with the Lockdown Cocktail community.
* be able to instinctively navigate the website to find the information required efficiently.
* enjoy the experience of entering a website that makes me feel good.
* be able to contact Lockdown Cocktail to request any cocktail receipes that may not be available within the search feature.



#### Scope
After analysis of the user stories, I have decided that I cannot implement all user's needs at this time so have decided on the below features to be my initial minimum scope.

* Random Cocktail feature from API
* Search Cocktail feature from API
* Responsive design
* Social Media links

#### Structure
I wanted the structure of the website to be a one page scroller as this is a modern choice and my target audience is fairly young. I think a navbar will lend a good UX to point the user
towards the contact page but other than that all content will remain on one page. I imagined users accessing the site from their phones during lockdown and so a one page scroller may keep users
on the site longer on mobile devices.

#### Skeleton
I designed wireframes for mobile, tablet and desktop using Balsamiq.

All three pages of the website are viewable in PDF using the following link:

#### Surface
Colours
A light, pastel colour scheme has been chosen for the website. The colour choices are to entice the chosen user (females aged 18-40) to enjoy the site. The choices also reflect the bright colours of some cocktails.
Pink
White #fafafa
Light Grey

I have used the Google Fonts: Elsie Swash Caps and Antic Didone.

### Deployment

Although I didn't end up using the code, so it is not referenced within my random-cocktail.js, this link led me to a different solution.
