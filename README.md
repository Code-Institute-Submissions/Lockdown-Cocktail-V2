# Lockdown-Cocktail-V2
## Code Institute Milestone Project 2: Interactive Frontend Development

Lockdown Cocktail is a fun and informative website for cocktail drinkers. 
During Covid-19, local and national lockdowns have meant that cocktail bars
have been closed to the public meaning those who would normally consume 
cocktails at a bar have been unable to do so. 
Disclaimer: Lockdown Cocktail does not encourage excessive drinking and is 
in no way responsible for consumer behaviour whilst using their website.
